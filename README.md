# CCI_S2_Coding2_Final-Project

**Project Summary**

Use opencv, numpy, matplot, scikit-image in Python to create different image filters to show the beautiful scenery of London, then use dash to show before after as an album.

‘When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.’  Everytime I walk on the streets of London, I feel that every landscape is an oil painting. This reminds me of one of my favourite impressionism artists -Claude Monet. 

As a overseas student, the life of studying in London is a memory that I will never forget in my life.  So I hope to record the beautiful scenery of London in the form of paintings and make it into 'an album'.
